# Connect-Four
Connect Four with Python

In this project I aim to create a connect four that utilizes machine learning. So far I have created a connect four game that can be played with user inputs. 

I'm currently working to right code so that a user can play agaist a computer. Once the computer has a set of basic rules I'm planning to save the game history every time a game is played. With this file the computer can use the game history to determine the best next move based on past games.
