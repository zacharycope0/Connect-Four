# Connect-Four
Connect Four with Python

This application allows a user to play Connect Four against a computer. To play download the PlayAgainsComputer folder and run ConnectFourGame.py. Please note that the board doesn't show up correctly when you run in a Window's terminal. You can get around the problem by running the code in an IDE.

So far the computer determines its moves based on the rules in the code. My next step for this project is to improve the computers strategy with machine learning.  If successful the computer will be able to improve each time it plays.
